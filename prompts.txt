Hello ! I want to build a joke webpage for a friend's treasure hunt. I want only static javascript + html + javascript code. It must be themed like a secret spy/mercenary website, like everything is confidential highly secret john wick/hitman stuff. It has a "contracts" menu that shows a list of fake mission contracts,, and it has a messaging menu that brings up conversations in a whatsapp style (behind the scene it should be a json so that I can edit it easily). Can you give me the javascript+html+css code please?
